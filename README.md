# Interaction of body position and object type on manual sampling

This repository contains Python and R code used to analyse data for the paper:  
**"Towards understanding free-flowing manual sampling: real-time interaction between body position and object type in 9-month-olds"**  
by Agata Kozioł, Zuzanna Laudańska, Karolina Babis, Hana D'Souza and Przemysław Tomalski (in press).

## Files Overview

- `import_data.py`  
  Processes raw coding data from EAF files and prepares datasets for further analysis.

- `plot_data.py`  
  Contains functions for creating boxplots to visualise the duration and frequency of manual sampling interactions across different postures and object types. Generates figures used in the paper.
  
- `main.py` 
  Runs import and data visualisation from scripts above
  
- `R/art_anova.R`  
  Conducts ART-ANOVA for the dependent variable (sampling duration or frequency) and the interaction between body position and type of object
  
## Purpose

This code was developed to support the analysis and visualisation of behavioural data in the referenced study.
